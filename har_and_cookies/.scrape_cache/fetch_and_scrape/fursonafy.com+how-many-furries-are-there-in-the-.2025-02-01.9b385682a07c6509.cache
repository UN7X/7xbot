Introduction
Have you ever wondered how many furries there are in the world? The furry community, known for its fascination with anthropomorphic animal characters, has grown significantly over the years. This article delves into the complexities of estimating the global furry population, providing insights from surveys, studies, and convention data.
Defining the Furry Fandom
What Is A Furry?
Furries are individuals who enjoy characters and stories featuring anthropomorphic animals, which are animals with human-like qualities such as walking on two legs, wearing clothes, or speaking. The fandom includes a wide range of interests, from creating and sharing art and stories to wearing elaborate costumes (fursuits) and participating in online communities.

Origins & Evolution
The furry fandom began to take shape in the 1980s, growing out of science fiction and comic book conventions where fans of anthropomorphic characters started to gather. Over the decades, it has evolved into a vibrant and diverse community, with members from all over the world engaging in various forms of creative expression.
Estimating the Number of Furries Globally
Challenges in Counting
Estimating the number of furries is challenging due to the lack of official records and the dispersed nature of the community. Many furries participate anonymously online or may not attend conventions, making it difficult to obtain accurate numbers.
Surveys and Studies
Several surveys and studies have attempted to estimate the size of the furry community. One notable source is FurScience, a research group that has conducted extensive surveys of the fandom. According to their data, the furry population is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands worldwide. Other studies and anecdotal evidence suggest similar numbers, although precise figures are hard to pin down.
