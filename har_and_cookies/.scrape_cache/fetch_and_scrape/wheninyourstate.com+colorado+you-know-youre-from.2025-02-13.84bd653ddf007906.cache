Colorado isn’t just a state; it’s a lifestyle. From the Rocky Mountains to the mile-high city, the Centennial State has its own unique flavor. If you’ve spent any time here, you’ve probably caught yourself saying these things. Let’s see just how Colorado you really are!

“The mountains are calling, and I must go.” “Fourteeners? I’ve done a few.” “It’s not cold unless it’s below zero.” “What’s your favorite craft brewery?” “We don’t have humidity here.” “I’ve got a season pass.” “I’ll just take I-70.” “I always carry layers.” “Can you believe how flat Kansas is?” “I moved here for the outdoors.” “Altitude sickness? Drink more water.” “Legalized it! “Sunshine 300 days a year.” “Is that a Subaru or a Jeep?” “Sorry, I can’t—powder day!”
“The mountains are calling, and I must go.”
Whether it’s hiking, skiing, or just admiring the view, you can’t resist the pull of the Rockies. They’re your playground and your sanctuary.
“Fourteeners? I’ve done a few.”
Climbing a mountain over 14,000 feet is basically a rite of passage in Colorado, and you’ve probably got a checklist of the ones you’ve conquered.
“It’s not cold unless it’s below zero.”
A true Coloradan knows that winter isn’t a big deal unless the temperature dips into the negatives. Anything above that? Just a little brisk.
“What’s your favorite craft brewery?”
With more breweries per capita than almost anywhere else, discussing craft beer is practically a state pastime. And yes, you’ve definitely had a few IPAs with names like “Powderhound” or “Rocky Mountain Haze.”
“We don’t have humidity here.”
Dry air is your friend. You’re used to chapped lips and the occasional nosebleed, but you wouldn’t trade it for the sticky humidity of other places.
“I’ve got a season pass.”
Whether it’s for skiing, snowboarding, or hitting up the national parks, having a season pass is just common sense. You’re outdoors every chance you get.
“I’ll just take I-70.”
You know the love-hate relationship with Interstate 70. It’s your gateway to adventure, but also the source of epic traffic jams, especially on the weekends.
“I always carry layers.”
Colorado weather is unpredictable, and you’ve learned to be prepared. It could be sunny and 70 degrees one minute and snowing the next.
“Can you believe how flat Kansas is?”
Driving east out of Colorado gives you a newfound appreciation for the mountains and makes you wonder how people survive in such flat terrain.
“I moved here for the outdoors.”
Whether you’re a native or a transplant, chances are the outdoor lifestyle is what drew you to Colorado—and you never looked back.
“Altitude sickness? Drink more water.”
You’ve got the insider tips for surviving at elevation—hydration is key, and you’ve learned the hard way. Newcomers, take note!
“Legalized it!
Colorado was ahead of the curve on cannabis legalization, and it’s no longer a big deal. Whether you partake or not, it’s just part of the culture now.
“Sunshine 300 days a year.”
You’ve probably bragged to out-of-staters about how sunny it is here. And no, you don’t miss the gloomy days that other places call “normal.”
“Is that a Subaru or a Jeep?”
