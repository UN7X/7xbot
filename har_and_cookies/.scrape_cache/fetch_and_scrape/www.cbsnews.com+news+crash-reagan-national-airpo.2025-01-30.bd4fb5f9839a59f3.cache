A passenger jet and a Black Hawk helicopter collided in midair Wednesday and crashed into the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. President Trump confirmed Thursday that there were no survivors. Many of the victims have yet to be publicly identified.
The plane, American Eagle Flight No. 5342, a regional jetliner, was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members on a flight from Wichita, Kansas. There were three soldiers aboard the U.S. Army's Sikorsky H-60, a Defense Department official told CBS News.
At least 40 bodies had been recovered as of Thursday evening, a law enforcement source told CBS News.
District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Chief John Donnelly earlier said that efforts at the scene had switched from a rescue operation to a recovery operation.
Here's what we know so far about the crash:
What happened?
American Eagle Flight No. 5342, which was operated by PSA Airlines, collided midair with a Sikorsky H-60 helicopter at around 9 p.m. Wednesday while approaching a runway at Reagan National Airport, the FAA said. The plane had taken off from Wichita, Kansas.
American Eagle and PSA Airlines are subsidiaries of American Airlines.
The helicopter involved in the collision was on a training flight and had belonged to B Company, 12th Aviation Battalion out of Fort Belvoir in Virginia, Joint Task Force-National Capitol Region media chief Heather Chairez told CBS News.
A livestream camera at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., captured the moment of the collision. The video, which has been verified by CBS News, shows an explosion in the area of the Potomac River at 8:47 p.m. Eastern.
What we know about the the search operation
D.C. Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly told reporters in a news briefing Thursday morning that 27 bodies had been recovered from the plane and one from the helicopter.
He said, "We don't believe there are any survivors," adding that the efforts at the scene have switched from a rescue operation to a recovery operation.
"It's a highly complex operation, the conditions out there are extremely rough for the responders. It's cold. They're dealing with relatively windy conditions," Donnelly said.
CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave reported that human remains and debris were washing up on the Virginia side of the Potomac River.
He said the plane broke into multiple pieces that were sitting in 5-8 feet of water.
The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, commonly known as black boxes, have been recovered from the crashed plane, the NTSB confirmed. They will be analyzed at the NTSB lab, which is located about a mile from the crash site.
Divers have had some access to the aircraft's cabin. Luggage is among items divers have recovered.
