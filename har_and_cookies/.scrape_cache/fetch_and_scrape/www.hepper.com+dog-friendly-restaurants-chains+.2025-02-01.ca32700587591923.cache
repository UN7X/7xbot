It‚Äôs uncommon to find restaurants that allow dogs inside because of food safety and sanitation concerns. Some local restaurants may allow dogs inside, but they‚Äôre pretty uncommon. However, you can find some restaurant chains that allow dogs in their outdoor seating areas. Some locations will even go the extra mile and have a special dog menu.
If you‚Äôre looking to dine with your dog, it‚Äôs important to call the establishment beforehand to determine whether dogs are allowed in the outdoor seating areas. Here are some restaurant chains that you can contact to see if your dog is allowed to sit on their patios.
The 15 Dog-Friendly Restaurants and Chains
1. Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar

Most Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar locations have a dog-friendly patio. So, while your dog may not be allowed indoors, they can still enjoy sitting outside with you. A great thing about Lazy Dog is that it also carries a dog menu . So, your dog can enjoy a tasty hamburger patty bowl or a grilled chicken breast. Keep in mind that Lazy Dog has very clear rules laid out in their pet policy. Make sure to read the rules beforehand so that everyone can have a safe and enjoyable dining experience.
2. Shake Shack

Shake Shack is another dog-friendly restaurant that has its own dog menu called the Woof Menu . The Woof Menu contains tasty treats that your dog can enjoy while you eat your own meal. One of the menu items is the Bag O‚Äô Bones . This treat was developed by Bocce‚Äôs Bakery and contains five beef and cheddar dog biscuits. They‚Äôre a much safer alternative to giving your dog pieces of your burger.
3. Panera Bread

Panera Bread doesn‚Äôt allow pets inside its establishments. However, many Panera Bread locations have an outdoor seating area. Dogs can often sit in these areas, but make sure to ask the restaurant manager about their pet policy. Some locations may not allow dogs in their outdoor areas.
You may want to bring some treats if you plan to bring your dog to Panera. Panera doesn‚Äôt have a menu for dogs, and most of its regular menu items aren‚Äôt very healthy for dogs to eat.
4. Starbucks

Most Starbucks locations will allow dogs on their patios. Just make sure that your dog is leashed and not sitting in the chairs or standing on the tables. You can also add a Puppuccino for your dog with your drink order. A Puppuccino is whipped cream served inside a Starbucks espresso cup. Just keep in mind that the whipped cream contains sugar, so it‚Äôs not the best option for dogs that are on a weight management plan.
5. Culver‚Äôs

Most Culver‚Äôs locations with an outdoor seating area allow dogs to sit there. In fact, many dogs enjoy visiting Culver‚Äôs . It‚Äôs best to go to Culver‚Äôs with a friend so that someone can stay outside with your dog while the other goes inside to order. Culver‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt have a dog menu, so make sure to bring some treats or chews to keep your dog occupied while you eat.
