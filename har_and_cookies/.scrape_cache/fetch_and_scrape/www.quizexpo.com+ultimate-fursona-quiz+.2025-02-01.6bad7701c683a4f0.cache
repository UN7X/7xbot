Brief History of Furrydom
Contrary to what most non-furries believe, fursona fandom dates back to the 1980s. Anthropomorphic creatures have always been an undeniable part of sci-fi and fiction. However, people started to relate to such characters when the internet became more accessible. That is because, before the internet, it was relatively hard for furdom fans to come out—as it sounds like a taboo or strange idea. However, people have created fursona communities since the 80s. And now, you can find large groups of fursuiters all around the world.
Things to Know Before Taking the Fursona Quiz
Our furry test distinguishes the differences between the fringe and mainstream segments of the community. So, it is best to know the variations and be familiar with the definitions before taking the questionary.
1. Furry Vs. Fursona
Furry is a broad term that describes both fictional anthropomorphic/feral creatures and their fans. However, a fursona is the textualized or visualized form of furries.
2. Fursuiter Vs. Non-Fursuiter
Fursuiters are fans who wear a full custom to represent their persona(s). Non-fursuiters are members of the community who do not own any custom/suit or own paraphernalia instead.
You do not have to have a furry persona to become a part of the community. Being a fan does not obligate you to create your suit or become a fursuiter. Recent data shows that less than 15% of the community members own a full suit.
3. Furry Fans Vs. Others
